    #   SSL Engine Switch:
    #   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
    SSLEngine on

    #   SSL Protocol support:
    #   List the enable protocol levels with which clients will be able to
    #   connect.  Disable SSLv2 access by default:
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3

    #   SSL Cipher Suite:
    #   List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
    #   See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
    SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5

    #   Server Certificate:
    # Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
    # the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
    # pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again.  A new
    # certificate can be generated using the genkey(1) command.

    #   Server Private Key:
    #   If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
    #   directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
    #   you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
    #   both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
